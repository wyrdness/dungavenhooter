      "full": "The Dungavenhooter is one of the most darkly humorous fearsome critters from American lumberjack folklore. This alligator-like creature has a tragic flaw: it was born without a mouth. Unable to eat, it expresses its frustration by violently clubbing fish with its powerful tail. The creature swims through rivers and lakes, killing fish it cannot consume, destined to starve to death despite being surrounded by potential food. The absurd tragedy of the Dungavenhooter represents the fearsome critter tradition's darker humor, presenting a creature defined entirely by futility and frustration."
